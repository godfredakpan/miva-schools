## 4. Note-Making

### User Action:
- While watching a video, users can make notes on specific parts of the lesson.

### Front End to Backend:
- The front-end captures note data and sends a request to the backend API to store the note.

### Backend Processing:
- The backend stores the note data in the database, associating it with the respective video lesson.

### Front End Handling:
- The front-end updates the UI to reflect the user's notes.

## 5. Quiz Interaction

### User Action:
- Users navigate to the "Quizzes" section from the dashboard.

### Front End to Backend:
- The front-end requests quiz data from the backend API.

### Backend Processing:
- The backend retrieves quiz data from the database.
- The quiz list is sent as part of the response to the front end.

### Front End Handling:
- The front-end displays the list of available quizzes.
- Users can select and take a quiz, with the front end managing user responses.

## Conclusion

The interactions between the front-end and backend components are crucial for delivering a functional and responsive web application. These interactions facilitate seamless user experiences, allowing learners to access courses, watch videos, make notes, and participate in quizzes. The clear communication between the front end and backend ensures that user actions result in accurate and timely data processing and presentation on the user interface.


# C - Design Patterns, Coding Principles, and Standards Used
